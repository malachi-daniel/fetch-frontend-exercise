## About The Project

![Exercise Screen Shot][exercise-screenshot]

This is a modern sign-up page made for Fetch Reward's frontend engineering apprenticeship. The project was made to be easily re-used and has minimal dependencies. It makes a GET request to a Fetch Rewards endpoint to grab data for the two dropdowns.


### Built With

* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) (requires React.js > 16.8)
* HTML5
* Pure CSS

### Notable features
* Fetch Rewards themed
* Responsive - looks good on any size window
* Does not allow form submission without the entire form being completed
* Provides feedback upon successful submission
* Uses no extra libraries for maximum compatibility (besides react)
* Uses built-in `fetch()` for ajax calls (pun intended)
